Simplify the UI.

== Not
No features hidden under small [v] buttons, behind tabs etc.
Not chat within meet, plus separate chat feature, but separate team chat. Only 1 chat.

= App tabs

If the user is in a meeting, the main app tabs allow to switch between features:
* Clicking on chat app tab opens the chat for that meeting that the user is in.
  (An indicator on the chat app tab icon will show how many new unread chat messages for the current meeting are waiting.)
* Clicking on Documents app tab opens the document that the meeting members are editing right now.
* Clicking the Meet app tab goes back to the videos of the participants.

If the user is in a chat with a person, and clicks on the Calendar app tab, he sees the appointsments he has with that person, and can add a new appointment
with that person. The calendar app keeps the person that I'm chatting with as context.
Same when I'm in a video conf meeting, and I switch to calendar, I can add a new appointment with that group or person which I have a meeting with.
When I selected a person in Contacts, and click on Chat, I am in the chat with that person that I selected in Contacts.

So, the mode switching / window type switching happens in the main app tab.
