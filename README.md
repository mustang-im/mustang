This is a prototype for new full-featured email client.
It is a desktop email client written entirely in JavaScript and HTML.
It should later run on smartphones as app as well, using a different UI.

It is currently based on Electron as runtime, but may be adapted to use
other runtimes like Cordova as well.

It makes an emphasis on clean code architecture and design and APIs,
to allow easy modification and adaptions to new needs.
It will also support extensions, using a high-level API.

The target user group is primarily existing desktop users, but also
all those people who use webmail today.

For now, this is just a modest start.
