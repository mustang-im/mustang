Mustang

This is a new full-featured email client, chat, video conference,
calendar, contacts and files app.

It is a full desktop client for Linux, Windows, macOS, Android and iOS,
running as local app, and written entirely in TypeScript and HTML.

It is currently based on Electron and CapacitorJS as runtime,
but can use other runtimes like Gecko as well.

It makes an emphasis on clean code architecture and design and APIs,
with a strict separation between logic and UI code, and observers,
to allow easy modification and adaptions to new needs.
It will also support extensions, using a high-level API.
