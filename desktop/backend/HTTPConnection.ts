/**
 * A HTTP(S) client that runs all requests over a single TCP connection.
 *
 * Connection-based HTTP authentication (NTLM, Negotiate) authenticates the
 * TCP connection, not the HTTP request. `fetch()` hides which connection of
 * its pool a request goes out on, which makes such authentication unreliable.
 * This class guarantees at most one TCP connection at any time, and each
 * response reports which connection served it (`socketID`), so the caller
 * always knows whether the connection is still the one it authenticated.
 *
 * This is only the transport. The authentication handshake logic is driven
 * by the caller in app/logic (see `NTLMConnection`), based on `socketID`.
 *
 * The caller should send one request at a time. Concurrency comes from
 * using multiple `HTTPConnection` objects (see `NTLMConnectionPool`).
 *
 * Limitations: Connects directly, ignoring OS proxy settings, and does
 * not follow redirects. NTLM cannot pass through a proxy or redirect
 * anyway, because both break the end-to-end TCP connection.
