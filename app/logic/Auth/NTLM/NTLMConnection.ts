/**
 * A single HTTP connection to a server that uses NTLM authentication.
 *
 * NTLM authenticates the TCP connection, not the HTTP request:
 * 1. We send a Type 1 (negotiate) message and get a 401 with the
 *    Type 2 message (server challenge) back.
 * 2. We answer the challenge with a Type 3 (login) message, which rides
 *    on the first real request. So a fresh connection costs exactly one
 *    extra round trip.
 * 3. All later requests on the same TCP connection are authenticated
 *    without any `Authorization` header.
 *
 * Both handshake steps and all later requests must run on the same
 * TCP connection. The backend `HTTPConnection` guarantees a single
 * connection and reports which connection served each response
 * (`socketID`), so we always *know* whether our login applies, instead
 * of guessing. Whenever the server closed the connection and a request
 * ran on a new one, we see the changed `socketID` and re-authenticate.
 *
 * One request at a time per connection. For parallel requests, use
 * multiple connections, see `NTLMConnectionPool`.
