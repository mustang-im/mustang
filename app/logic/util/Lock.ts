/**
 * Allows a function to ensure that it will never run in parallel
 * with another instance of the same function.
 * Instead, it will wait until the other instance is finished.
 *
 * How to use:
 * 1. Create one instance of this class per function and object that you want to guard.
 * 1.1. If you allow multiple objects of class `A` to run their `A.runner()` independent of each
 *   other, but the same instance of `A` cannot have multiple `A.runner()` running in parallel,
 *   then A class should have an instance of this lock as property:
 *   `_runnerLock = new Lock();`.
 * 1.2. If `A.runner()` cannot run in parallel with any other `A.runner()`, even if it's on another object,
 *   then you should make the lock a `static` property on `A`:
 *   `static _runnerLock = new Lock();`
 *
 * 2. In your function, lock and unlock before and after the critical code:
 * ```
 * async runner() {
 *   await someUncriticalCode();
 *   let lock = await this._runnerLock.lock(); // will wait until the others completed
 *   try {
 *     await criticalCodePath();
 *   } finally {
 *     lock.release();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * 3. Callers of your function can call it in the normal way:
 * `await a.runner();`
 *
 * 4. If your function should not be repeated, you can check whether the lock()
 *   was waiting or not. If it was waiting, you can skip running your function a second time:
 * ```
 * async runner() {
 *   let lock = await this._runnerLock.lock(); // wait until the others completed
 *   if (lock.wasWaiting) {
 *     lock.release();
 *     return;
 *   }
 *   try {
 *     await someCriticalCodeWhichNeedsToRunOnlyOnce();
 *   } finally {
 *     lock.release();
 *   }
 * ```
 *   However, not that while the previous function started and this function started,
 *   your application state might have changed.
