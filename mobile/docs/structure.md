### Android

The app config directory and files directory should be in `/data/data/im.mustang.capa` on the Android device. Writing files outside of this directory cause problems and requires extra permissions. Files directory could be outside but we need to find the API to get the specific path.

> All apps (root or not) have a default data directory, which is /data/data/<package_name>. By default, the apps databases, settings, and all other data go here. This directory is "private" to the app â€“ which means no other app and not even the user can access data in it (without root permissions).

### iOS

#### Node Native

Node native modules should not be included and be explicitly removed in the Frameworks section of `App/Target` setting in Xcode. Because without doing this the app will throw a memory error on launching with an error message like `Release/[node native] not found` in debug.

_You'll likely see it automatically added in the setting with `Do not embed` selected so make sure you select it and click the minus button on the bottom left of the section._

#### Debugging

`console.log` are printed to the debug console in Xcode therefore you must you Xcode to see it. Even the frontend `console.log` are printed to the debug console in Xcode.

#### Fetch

`fetch()` requires WASM which is not supported on iOS. That's why `node-fetch` is used to replace it.

#### WASM

> On iOS, WASM is unsupported because it requires Just-in-time (JIT) interpretation, which is forbidden by Apple's App Store guidelines.
