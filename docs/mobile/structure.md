### Android

The app config directory and files directory should be in `/data/data/im.mustang.capa` on the Android device. Writing files outside of this directory cause problems and requires extra permissions. Files directory could be outside but we need to find the API to get the specific path.

> All apps (root or not) have a default data directory, which is /data/data/<package_name>. By default, the apps databases, settings, and all other data go here. This directory is "private" to the app â€“ which means no other app and not even the user can access data in it (without root permissions).
